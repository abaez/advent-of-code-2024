## 1. Description

[Advent of Code][2] is an event on doing twenty five coding challenges on December. Here's a small take of doing the set up with using [Deno]][3]. Mostly cause [author here][4] wants stickers!

## 2. Usage

To get set up, either have [deno][3] or have [direnv installed][5] and [nix available][6]. All the commands to do what you want are on [deno tasks][7]. However, are available with small recipes using [just][8], for less typing I suppose.
